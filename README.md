# Password-Generator-Webpage

I was tasked to finish a password generator feature with selectable criteria via prompts for a client. The application first prompts the user for the desired length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters), then prompts the user for the password criteria with single letters representing criteria for ease of use, a password is then generated from the specified criteria and shown in the textarea id in the HTML.

Took a while to figure out the selecting multiple criteria part, eventually getting there with the help of the string.includes method.

Couldn't get the cancel button events working properly.

### How To Use
Generate a password by:

- Inputting a password length between 8 and 128 characters.

- Selecting criteria by typing specified single characters with no spaces inbetween e.g. uns. This creates a uppercase, lowercase and special character password.
