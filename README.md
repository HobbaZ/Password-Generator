# Password-Generator-Webpage

I was tasked to finish a password generator feature with selectable criteria via prompts for a client. The application first prompts the user for the desired length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters), then prompts the user for the password criteria, the result is then shown in the textarea id in the HTML.

Took a while to figure out the selecting multiple criteria part, eventually getting there with the help of the string.includes method. Will put some security measures in if I have time.
